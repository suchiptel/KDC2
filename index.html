<h1>An Ideal Son</h1>
<p>'Balanam rodanam balam' - the cry of a baby is its strength. It frequently cries loudly. It often becomes impatient. At that age, tolerance is but zero. Everyone's experience, however, with Diwaliba's son was somewhat different. Talking about her son's tolerance, she would later say: "He had so much tolerance from a young age. Despite chickenpox sores leaking, Shantilal would barely protest. He was of a quiet nature from the very beginning. Perhaps that's why the parents decided to give the name of 'Shanti' ['Shanti' means peace] to their adorable son! Everyone experienced peace in his every action. Every action of his made everyone feel at peace. Peace spread when he spoke; peace even from his silence. Seeing him, one understood the truth of the saying: 'Akruti guan kathayati' - one's conduct reveals one's virtues.</p>
